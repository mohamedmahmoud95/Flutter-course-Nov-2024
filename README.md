Aloha there 

Welcome to my #Flutter Course Repository!

Each branch in this repository corresponds to a specific topic or session in the course. 

So you can follow along with the course content and refer to the branches for specific code examples and projects.


ðŸ“‚ #Repository Structure

The repository is divided into branches, each named to reflect the corresponding session or topic. 
You can switch between branches to find the code and resources for each part of the course. Below are samples of how I list the course branches:

1.	0_dart_basics - Learn the basics of Dart programming language, including variables, loops, functions, OOP, etc.
2.	1_flutter_built_in_widgets - Introduction to the built-in Flutter widgets like Container, Text, Image, etc.
3.	2_buttons_and_clickables - Handling user interactions with buttons, clickable widgets, and gestures.
4.	3_layouts_and_navigation - Building responsive layouts and navigating between screens.


ðŸš€ #How to Use this Repository

1.	Clone the Repository:
  
     	 git clone https://github.com/mohamedmahmoud95/Flutter-course-Nov-2024
     	 cd Flutter-course-Nov-2024

2.	Switch to a Branch:
     Each branch contains the code for a specific topic. To switch to a particular branch, use the following command:
  
    		git checkout <branch-name>

	For example, to view the code for Dart basics, use:

		git checkout 0_dart_basics

4.	Explore the Code:
    Each branch will have code files and a folder structure relevant to that topic. The code is organized into folders and files based on the course structure.
    
    If you face any issues running the cloned app, please make sure that you have the correct path to main.dart in the run configuration.
    
    Feel free to reach out whenever you need any help.
